words
=====

This project is an attempt to create a list of words under creative commons share-alike licensing, for use in games.

Any wordlists in this repository could be built from a few sources. Most notable are the Google Ngram Project, and Wiktionary.

Any Python scripts, unless otherwise noted, were written by me.

Google Ngram Project
=====
In order to build a list of words with an associated measure of how common they are, I utilized the Google Ngram project, which you can read more about that here:

As of March 5, 2013 (when I originally sourced the english 1-grams), the usage of words from that project is under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License, which you can read more about here:

This licensing is important since I wish to use these words in my future work/products.

I would like to thank the Google Ngram Project for their astounding work, and their willingness to share such information without restriction.

Wiktionary
=====
In order to provide definitions for words, I utilized a download of Wiktionary, heavily parsed and pruned so as to clean up the display of the definitions. I'm still investigating the full licensing of the definitions, as it appears that some reference other dictionaries, and I want to ensure that I'm not breaking any copyright by pruning references or something similar.
